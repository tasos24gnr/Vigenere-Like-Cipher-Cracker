# Vigenere-Like-Cipher-Cracker
The Vigenere-Like Cipher Cracker is a tool designed to decrypt ciphertexts encrypted using a Vigenere-like cipher, where byte-wise XOR is used instead of traditional addition modulo 26. This program aims to aid in the decryption of encrypted messages without prior knowledge of the encryption key.
